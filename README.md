# Reports-Dashboards-Visualizations-PowerBI-KPIs-Metrics
Features sample reports, dashboards, metrics, and KPIs built in Power BI. Note: all data labels, number, names, graph axes, etc. have been either hidden or blacked out to maintain privacy. These are only to be viewed as samples of my visualization style and metric-building capabilities. The real ones with labels and numbers look even better! The real ones are also dynamic and filterable.


All of these started out from a messy database and were transformed into beautiful reports via queries, data cleaning, data transformation, ETL pipelines, model building, and metric creation!
